Problem Statement
In today's fast-paced and increasingly digital world, traditional
banking methods often fail to meet the needs of modern
consumers. Many individuals, particularly those in remote or
underserved areas, face significant challenges in accessing
banking services due to the necessity of visiting physical
branches. This not only consumes valuable time but also creates
barriers for those with busy schedules or limited access to
transportation. Additionally, the inconvenience of long queues
and restricted bank hours further exacerbates the frustration
associated with managing financial transactions.
Moreover, while mobile money services have grown in popularity,
there remains a disconnect between these services and
traditional banking, limiting the ability of users to seamlessly
transfer funds between mobile money accounts and bank
accounts. This gap in service integration prevents users from fully
leveraging the convenience that digital financial tools can offer.
To address these issues, there is a clear need for a solution that
bridges the gap between mobile money services and traditional
banking, enabling users to deposit funds into their bank accounts
with ease, security, and convenience regardless of their location.
